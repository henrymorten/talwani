## Usage Python 

So the majority of indervidual components work with this - but I havent been able to find the motivation to stitch everything together. 

This code is based on a piece of software called Grav2D - written by Alan McCormack who has since retired from the university of Liverpool. 
It aims to model the effects on gravity of 2D polygons in the earths surface, using methods as described by Talwani et al. (1959).

Running 'main.py' loads the main GUI - that is only semi functional, as I have not added all of the functionality for everything intended. 

Running 'auto.py' is my first attempt at minimising the misfit between potental models and the observed gravitational anomalies - by varying the coordinates of the polygon vertices.
